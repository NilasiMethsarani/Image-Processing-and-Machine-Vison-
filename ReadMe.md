**Title: Image Processing Techniques Showcase**

**README:**

Welcome to the Image Processing Techniques Showcase repository! This repository contains a collection of practical implementations and demonstrations of fundamental image processing techniques. Whether you're a student learning about image manipulation or a developer looking to enhance your image processing skills, this repository has something to offer.

**Table of Contents**

1. **Vibrance Enhancement:** Explore how to enhance the vibrance of photographs using intensity transformations. Understand how to split images into different color planes, apply transformations, and recombine them.

2. **Histogram Equalization:** Learn about histogram equalization and its applications in image enhancement. Discover how to balance image histograms and compare before-and-after results.

3. **Zooming Images:** Dive into the world of image zooming. Implement both nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation methods to zoom images effectively.

4. **Sobel Filtering:** Explore edge detection through Sobel filtering. Use various methods to apply gradient-based filters for edge extraction.

5. **Foreground Histogram Equalization:** Learn how to perform histogram equalization on specific parts of an image. Explore the concept of foreground extraction and equalization.

6. **Images and Outputs:** Visualize the techniques in action with provided input images and corresponding outputs. Understand the transformations through plots and histograms.

**Instructions**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to specific directories for each technique.
3. Run the provided scripts using your preferred Python interpreter.
